		<div class="bug note">
			<p>
				There are several known problems with the
				reaction rule editor; in particular, making
				changes to the redex that conflict with changes
				to the reactum can cause consistency problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Big Red can detect these problems, but it can't
				yet fix them &mdash; it will simply refuse to
				save inconsistent documents.
