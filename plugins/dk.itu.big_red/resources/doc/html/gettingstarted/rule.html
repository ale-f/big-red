			Creating a reaction rule
		</h2>
		<div class="bug note">
			<p>
				There are several known problems with the
				reaction rule editor; in particular, making
				changes to the redex that conflict with changes
				to the reactum can cause consistency problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Big Red can detect these problems, but it can't
				yet fix them &mdash; it will simply refuse to
				save inconsistent documents.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Reaction rules specify the ways in which bigraphical
			reactive systems are allowed to develop.
		</p>
		<p>
			To create a new reaction rule, choose <span class="menu-path">Big
			Red &rarr; Reaction rule</span> from the <span class="menu-path">New</span>
			menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			As you build the redex, you'll notice that Big Red
			copies your modifications into the reactum.
		</p>
		<div class="info note">
			<p>
				Big Red represents reaction rules as a redex
				and an <em>edit script</em> &mdash; a list of
				the changes that transform the redex into the
				reactum.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although this is a slight deviation from the
				formal bigraphical model, it's handled
				transparently &mdash; Big Red automatically
				generates a traditional reactum when one is
				requested.
