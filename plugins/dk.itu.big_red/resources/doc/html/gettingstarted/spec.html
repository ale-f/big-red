			Creating a simulation spec
		</h2>
		<p>
			At this point, your project contains all of the pieces
			of a complete bigraphical reactive system:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				it has a signature, defining its controls;
			</li>
			<li>
				it has an agent, defining its initial state;
				and
			</li>
			<li>
				it has some reaction rules, specifying how the
				agent can be changed.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Big Red's last file format, the <em>simulation
			spec</em>, is used to group these together into a
			complete system, ready for execution by simulation
			tools.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you created the project, Big Red automatically
			created a simulation spec &mdash; the <code class="filename">PLACEHOLDER.bigraph-simulation-spec</code>
			file in the project's root. Double-click it to open it.
		</p>
		<p class="info note">
			To create a new simulation spec, choose <span class="menu-path">Big
			Red &rarr; Simulation spec</span> from the <span class="menu-path">New</span>
			menu.

			Now that the simulation spec is complete, the <span class="button">Export...</span>
			button in the bottom-right of the editor has become
			active. Use the tool menu to select a target for your
			simulation spec, then click <span class="button">Export...</span>.

		<p class="info note">
			The contents of the tool menu will vary depending on
