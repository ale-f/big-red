	Introduction
</h2>
<p>
	This is a tutorial for new Big Red developers. It introduces some of
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rcp">Eclipse</a>'s extensibility
	mechanisms, and shows how they can be used to add features to Big Red.
</p>
<p>
	This tutorial is a worked example. By the end, you'll have extended Big
	Red to support a <em>scope rule</em>.
</p>
<p class="info note">
	Full source code for the completed extension can be found in the
	<code>doc/plugins/examples/scope/</code> directory of the Big
	Red source repository.

	Scope rules
</h2>
<p>
	Normally, ports in a bigraph can be connected to any other ports.
	Consider the following bigraph:
</p>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="scope.png">
</div>
<p>
	The <span style="color: #008000">green edge</span> on the left
	connects the <span style="color: #a52a2a"><code>D</code> node</span>
	to its children, the <span style="color: #ff0000"><code>A</code>
	node</span> and the <span style="color: #00ff00"><code>C</code>
	node</span>, and to its grandchild, the <span style="color: #1e90ff"><code>B</code>
	node</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000">red edge</span> on
	the right connects the <span style="color: #a52a2a"><code>D</code>
	node</span> to its sibling, the <span style="color: #1e90ff"><code>B</code>
	node</span>. Both of these edges are completely valid.
</p>
<p>
	Introducing a <em>scope rule</em> restricts the connectivity of certain
	ports. Here are two possible scope rules:&mdash;
</p>
<ol>
<li>
	A port can be connected only to its node's siblings.
</li>
<li>
	A port can be connected only to its node's descendants.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Applying the first of these rules to the single port of
	<span style="color: #a52a2a">control <code>D</code></span>, for
	example, would forbid the <span style="color: #008000">green edge</span>,
	and applying the second would forbid the <span style="color: #ff0000">red
	edge</span>.

	The basics of Eclipse
</h2>
<p>
	The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rcp">Eclipse Rich Client
	Platform</a> (the <em>RCP</em>) is the foundation upon which Big Red is
	built. In fact, all Eclipse applications &mdash; including the
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/">Java Development Tools</a>
	(the <em>JDT</em>), the Java IDE that most developers associate with
	the name <q>Eclipse</q> &mdash; are built on top of the RCP.
</p>
<div class="info note">
	<p>
		The Eclipse world is very fond of layers of abstraction: the
		RCP is itself built on top of an extensible platform called
		<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/">Equinox</a>,
		which is an implementation of a modular runtime environment
		called <a href="http://www.osgi.org/">OSGi</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		(Many of the concepts introduced by this section are actually
		OSGi concepts, not specific to Eclipse.)
	</p>
</div>
<p>
	The RCP consists of a number of <em>plugins</em>. Each of these plugins
	implements a small piece of the Eclipse environment &mdash; for
	example, one plugin implements the Eclipse widget toolkit, another
	implements the user interface, and yet another implements the
	workspace.
</p>
<p>
	The plugins that make up the RCP only define the base of the Eclipse
	platform. In order to add support for specific tasks (like writing Java
	code &mdash; or, indeed, building bigraphical reactive systems), more
	plugins must be added. Many plugins are required to make a useful
	application &mdash; for example, the <em>Eclipse Modeling Tools</em>
	environment is made up of more than seven hundred plugins!
</p>
<p>
	At the most fundamental level, this is all Big Red is: a collection of
	plugins that augment the RCP with the ability to create, modify, and
	manipulate the bigraphical model. (The JDT, although orders of
	magnitude more complex than Big Red, is built in the same way.)
</p>
<p>
	Plugins contain more than just code, though: they also contain metadata
	in their <em>manifests</em>. Amongst other things, manifests
	define:&mdash;
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		the <em>dependencies</em> of a plugin;
	<li>
		the <em>extensions</em> that a plugin contributes to the
		environment; and
	<li>
		the <em>extension points</em>, if any, to which other plugins
		can contribute extensions.
</ul>
<h3 id="extension_points_and_extensions">
	Extension points and extensions
</h3>
<p>
	Extension points and extensions allow plugins to instantiate and
	manipulate code contributed by their <em>dependents</em>.
