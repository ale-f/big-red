	This guide will take you through the construction of a simple bigraph using Big Red.
	(Remember that you can move this guide around; drag its tab to the bottom of the window to
	see the main workspace.)

	<li>
		<h2>Add ports to the bigraph</h2>
		<p>
			Bigraphs are useless without connections joining nodes together, and nodes
			can only be joined at <em>ports</em> - designated connection points.
			Let's add a few ports to get started.
		</p>
		<p>
			Go to the <u>B</u>igraph menu, then select <q><u>P</u>orts...</q>. The
			Ports wizard will appear.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/ports.png" />
		<p>
			The option we want - <q>Add a new port</q> - is already
			selected, so click <u>N</u>ext. The port editor will appear.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/port-editor.png" />
		<p>
			We're going to model a simple office environment, so let's create the first
			port: <code>telephone-cable</code>, which models the wire that connects a
			telephone to the telephone system. Type this into the <u>N</u>ame box.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/telephone-cable.png" />
		<p>
			<code>telephone-cable</code> can connect to the telephone system, so we'll
			model that as the port <code>telephone-system</code>. Click <u>A</u>dd; a
			new entry appears in the large frame, ready for editing. Type
			<code>telephone-system</code> into the new entry. (If you make a mistake,
			you can click it again to edit it.)
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/telephone-system.png" />
		<p>
			That's it; click <u>F</u>inish to create this port. (Notice that you don't
			need to make a separate <code>telephone-system</code> port - it's
			created implicitly.)
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>Adding a control</h2>
		<p>
			Bigraphs have the concept of <em>controls</em> (essentially classes which
			govern some aspects of a node's display and function); each node on the
			bigraph has a control, which dictates its appearance and its ports. Since
			we're modelling an office environment, we'll need two controls to
			start: <code>Building</code> and <code>Telephone</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Go to the <u>B</u>igraph menu, then select <q><u>C</u>ontrols...</q>.
			The Controls wizard will appear.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/controls.png" />
		<p>
			As before, <q>Add a new control</q> has already been selected, so click
			<u>N</u>ext.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/control-editor.png" />
		<p>
			The control editor might look complicated, but don't worry! It's actually
			quite easy to use. Type <code>Building</code> in the <u>N</u>ame field, and
			then - using the drop-down boxes - set the <u>T</u>op port to
			<code>telephone-system</code>.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/control-editor-2.png" />
		<p>
			The port is now configured; any <code>Telephone</code>s we add to the
			bigraph will be able to connect to <code>Building</code>s.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's change the look of this control. The default size of 50x50 is fine,
			but it should be resizable, so tick the <q><u>A</u>llow resizing</q> box at
			the bottom - and change the <u>A</u>ppearance drop-down box to
			<q>Oval</q>.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/control-editor-3.png" />
		<p>
			All done; click <u>F</u>inish. Now make another control, <code>Telephone</code>,
			with these settings:
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/control-telephone.png" />
		<p>
			Once you've done that, we can move on to actually creating the bigraph.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>Adding the nodes</h2>
		<p>
			You should be back at the main window at this point. From the list of
			tools (the <em>palette</em>), choose <q>Root</q>.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/root.png" />
		<p>
			The formal language of bigraphs only allows us to create nodes if they're
			inside a <em>root</em>, so we need one of those before we can go any
			further. Move the mouse into the blank white area (the <em>canvas</em>),
			and draw a large rectangle with it (click, hold, and drag). This will add
			a root - shown as a white rectangle with rounded corners and a dashed
			border - to the bigraph.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/root-2.png" />
		<p>
			(Notice the black border around it, and the square handles around the
			border; this tells us that this item is <em>selected</em>. When something
			is selected, you can click and drag the handles to resize it - or
			you can click and drag the figure itself to move it around.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Now select the <q>Node</q> tool from the palette, and draw another large
			rectangle - <em>inside</em> the root.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/root-3.png" />
		<p>
			This node doesn't have a control, so it has no ports and a very dull
			appearance. Double-click it, and the Properties view will appear on the
			left-hand side of the window.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/properties.png" />
		<p>
			Its control is <code>Unknown</code>. This is no good; obviously we want
			it to be <code>Building</code>. Click on the <code>Unknown</code> text, and
			it'll become another drop-down box - which you can use to choose
			<code>Building</code>!
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/building.png" />
		<p>
			(Notice the red dot at the top of the <code>Building</code> figure; this is
			how Big Red shows ports.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Now make a few smaller nodes and give them the control <code>Telephone</code>,
			until your bigraph looks something like this:
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/nodes.png" />
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>Adding the edges</h2>
		<p>
			Adding connections between nodes - <em>edges</em> - is easy.
			When you use the <q>Edge</q> tool to connect two nodes, Big Red will
			automatically work out whether or not they have compatible ports -
			and it'll link those ports together for you, too.
		</p>
		<p>
			Select the <q>Edge</q> tool, and use it to draw a line between any of the
			<code>Telephone</code>s and the <code>Building</code>. The result will be
			something like this:
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/edge.png" />
		<p>
			Big Red uses <q>Manhattan routing</q> for edges, so - rather than
			just using a straight line between the source and the destination -
			the line can only turn ninety degrees at a time. This may not seem very
			useful now, but when you have lots of edges on a diagram, it makes it much
			more readable!
		</p>
		<p>
			Connect the remaining two <code>Telephone</code>s to the <code>Building</code>.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/bigraph.png" />
		<p>
			Congratulations - you've drawn your first Big Red bigraph!
		</p>
	</li>

		<h2>Saving and loading</h2>
		<p>
			To save your masterpiece, go to the <u>F</u>ile menu, and choose <u>S</u>ave.
			The standard file dialog will appear; call your bigraph <code>Office</code>,
			then click <u>O</u>K.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/file.png" />
		<p>
			If you don't add one yourself, Big Red will automatically append a
			<code>.bigred</code> suffix to the filename - so the file actually ends up
			being called <code>Office.bigred</code>.
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/suffix.png" />
		<p>
			Opening a previously-saved bigraph is similarly intuitive; go to <u>F</u>ile
			and choose <u>O</u>pen.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>
	<p>
		That's all for this guide; now you know how to add ports and controls to a
		bigraph, how to actually draw one, and how to save it out as a file.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course, Big Red can do <em>lots</em> more - but the best way to learn is through
		experimentation! For example, why not try using the Properties view to change the
		colour of one of the nodes in your diagram?
