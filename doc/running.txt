Running the development version of Big Red
==========================================

Big Red requires version 3.7 or later of the Eclipse Modeling Tools package,
which is available from <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads>.

Once you have a copy of Eclipse Modeling Tools:

  * import the "plugins/dk.itu.big_red" folder into the Eclipse workspace
    (File -> Import... -> Existing Projects into Workspace);
  * open Big Red's "plugin.xml" file; and
  * click the "Launch an Eclipse application" link (under the "Testing"
    heading).
