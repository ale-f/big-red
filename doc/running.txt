Running the development version of Big Red
==========================================

Big Red requires version 3.7 or later of the Eclipse Modeling Tools package,
which is available from <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads>.

Once you have a copy of Eclipse Modeling Tools:

  * import the "plugins/" folder into the Eclipse workspace (File menu ->
    Import... -> Existing Projects into Workspace);
  * open the "plugin.xml" file in the "BigMC for Big Red" project; and
  * click the "Launch an Eclipse application" link (under the "Testing"
    heading).

This will open a new copy of Eclipse, configured to include Big Red with BigMC
support. (The "doc/examples/" folder includes some sample bigraphical reactive
systems which you may want to import into the new workspace.)
