User documentation
==================

A correctly configured version of Big Red will contribute documentation to the
Eclipse help system under the title "Big Red help". You can also open these
help topics in any web browser -- see the directory

	plugins/dk.itu.big_red/resources/doc/html/

for all of the relevant content.
