Keeping Big Red up-to-date
==========================

The command line
----------------

The Git command to update your local copy of Big Red is simply:

	git pull

You'll usually need to refresh the Eclipse workspace for the changes to be
picked up, though.

From inside Eclipse
-------------------

If you have the EGit plugin installed, you can also perform these updates from
within Eclipse. (Many editions of Eclipse include this plugin by default; if
yours doesn't, you can get it from http://eclipse.org/egit/download/ .)

To associate an existing project with its Git repository:

	* right-click its entry in the Project Explorer and choose "Team ->
	  Share Project...";
	* tick the "Use or create repository in parent folder of project" box
	  at the top of the form (you should see something like "../../.git"
	  appear the "Repository" column); and
	* click "Finish".

(When this succeeds, the appearance of the project will change slightly -- an
orange bar will appear in the bottom-right-hand corner of its icon, and the
name of its repository and branch will appear after its name.)

Once you've done that, you can keep all the projects up-to-date by simply
right-clicking one of them and choosing "Team -> Pull".
