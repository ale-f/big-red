Data support in Big Red
=======================

Big Red's bigraph model has some early and limited support for data in the
form of "parameters", validated strings associated with Nodes.

Every Control can optionally have a single "parameter policy", which is a
class implementing the dk.itu.big_red.model.names.policies.INamePolicy
interface. Parameter policies do three things:

	* they check that parameter values are valid;
	* they normalise parameter values into a canonical form; and
	* they provide a default parameter value.

If a Node's Control has a parameter policy, then that Node must have a
parameter value. (It must not have one otherwise.) Parameters are set using
Big Red's change mechanisms, and are retrieved with the Node.getParameter
method.

Other than ensuring that they pass validation, Big Red doesn't do anything
with parameter values; it's entirely up to external tools to assign some
meaning to them.

Notes
-----

Parameters aren't fully supported by the UI at the moment. The bigraph editor
has good support for them (parameter values are displayed and can be edited),
but the signature editor has no way of assigning parameter policies to
Controls. (The signature file format has support for this, though.)

As parameters are an extension to the bigraph model, Big Red has an unusually
permissive attitude towards their presence (or absence). When bigraph files
are loaded, default values will be assigned to missing parameters, and
extraneous parameter values will be discarded.
