Data support in Big Red
=======================

Big Red has some early and limited support for data in the form of
"parameters", validated strings associated with nodes. (This is actually an
extension to the model contributed by the "org.bigraph.extensions.param"
plugin.)

Every control can optionally have a single "parameter policy", which is a
class implementing the org.bigraph.model.names.policies.INamePolicy interface.
Parameter policies do three things:

	* they check that parameter values are valid;
	* they normalise parameter values into a canonical form; and
	* they provide a default parameter value.

If a node's control has a parameter policy, then that node must have a
parameter value. (It must not have one otherwise.) Parameters can be modified
using Big Red's change mechanisms, and are stored in and retrieved from an
extended data field.

Other than ensuring that they pass validation, Big Red doesn't do anything
with parameter values; it's entirely up to external tools to assign some
meaning to them.

Data support in the UI
----------------------

Parameter policies can be assigned to controls in the signature editor: simply
right-click a control in the left-hand list view, choose the "Parameter"
option, and select the desired policy.

The bigraph editor will display an additional "Parameter" property for nodes
whose control defines a parameter policy; the values given here are naturally
validated by the parameter policy before being applied.

Notes
-----

As parameters are an extension to the bigraph model, Big Red has an unusually
permissive attitude towards their presence (or absence). When bigraph files
are loaded, default values will be assigned to missing parameters, and
extraneous parameter values will be discarded.
