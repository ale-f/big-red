Using Big Red together with BigMC
=================================

When the "BigMC for Big Red" plugin is active, Big Red has some integration
with BigMC, the bigraph model checker (http://bigraph.org/bigmc); Big Red
simulation specs can be converted into a corresponding BigMC term language
representation, and Big Red can visualise the results produced by BigMC.

If the "bigmc" executable isn't in your system's path, then you'll need to
tell the plugin where it can be found; this can be done from the "Big Red ->
BigMC for Big Red" preferences page inside Eclipse.

(This requires the development version of BigMC to work properly.)
