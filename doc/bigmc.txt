Using Big Red together with BigMC
=================================

When the "BigMC for Big Red" plugin is active, Big Red has some integration
with BigMC, the bigraph model checker (http://bigraph.org/bigmc); Big Red
simulation specs can be converted into a corresponding BigMC term language
representation, and Big Red can visualise the results produced by BigMC.

(There are some caveats, though; this only works when the "bigmc" executable
can be found in your system's path, and it requires that you use the
development version of BigMC.)
