The mutable model
=================

Although Big Red's implementation of the bigraphical model is mutable, its
objects expose only getters, not setters:

        Bigraph b;
        Root r1, r2;
        Node n;
        /* ... b contains r1 and r2, while r1 contains n... */
        assert(n.getParent() == r1); /* allowed */
        n.setParent(r2); /* not allowed */

Instead, the model introduces a layer of indirection: objects that encapsulate
the desired modifications are submitted to a /validator/, which makes sure that
the modification request makes sense, before being sent on to an /executor/,
which actually modifies the model.

Why?
----

* Undo and redo support for free

  Changes track enough information to reverse themselves, which makes it easy
  to apply and unapply them.

* Protects against both users' and programmers' mistakes

  As changes are the only way to modify the model, bugs in higher-level code
  are treated like user mistakes -- anything that leaves the model in an
  inconsistent state will be rejected.

* Temporary inconsistencies don't matter

  Some changes are validated only at the end of the validation process. This
  allows objects to be temporarily put into undesirable states without any
  consequences -- as long as those states are eventually resolved, the
  validator won't complain.

* Extensibility

  Plugins can contribute new steps to executors and validators, adding new
  kinds of modification -- or making existing checks more demanding!

How?
----

Modifying a Big Red model object is a three-step process:

	1. create objects that encapsulate the desired changes;
	2. validate them; and finally
	3. execute them.

(In practice, the last two steps can be grouped together -- changes are always
validated before they're executed.)

Simulation
----------

Validating and applying a single change is straightforward, but sequences of
changes are a bit trickier. Consider the following example:

	Change(rename root "0" to "1")
	Change(rename root "2" to "1")

In isolation, both changes are valid -- but applying either change makes it
impossible to apply the other (as that would cause a namespace collision). How
can this be tracked?

The simplest option would be to make a deep copy of the bigraph and to attempt
to modify that directly, leaving the original unchanged in the event of an
error. However, this causes serious performance problems -- particularly in the
Eclipse context, where the UI frequently speculatively creates and validates
changes. (Imagine making a new deep copy of a complex bigraph for every pixel
traversed as part of a drag operation...)

Instead, the model provides a class called the "property scratchpad", which
is used to temporarily store changes to individual property values. After
simulating the first change in a property scratchpad, for example, it might
contain the associations

	property "name" of (Root@10c) has value "1"
	property "1" of ((Bigraph@2e64)'s root namespace) has value (Root@10c)

These associations allow the second change to be rejected -- although the
underlying namespace has not been changed, the namespace can consult the
property scratchpad and sees that it contains incompatible changes.

(All of Big Red's model objects, and many of their associated helpers, expose
two accessors for each field -- one which retrieves the value directly and
another which first attempts to find it in a property scratchpad.)

Validators and executors
------------------------

Steps are simple, stateless objects that can only do three things: ignore,
accept, or reject a single change. (Step validators "accept" a change by
validating it, and step executors do so by executing it.)

Steps are aggregated together by managers, which provide the infrastructure
that makes up the complete process: they decompose (potentially nested) change
groups into a sequence of single changes, attempting to find one or more steps
to accept each change. (A change is rejected by the manager if no step accepted
it.)

Validator managers perform an extra function: they provide each step validator
with a "process", which provides a property scratchpad (to allow modifications
to the model to be propagated to subsequent steps) and a callback mechanism (to
allow parts of the validation process to be delayed until the end).

Extensions
----------

As validators and (particularly) executors may contain privileged code, it's
not normally possible to instantiate them -- they're usually private or
package-private classes which are instantiated statically before being
contributed to the static executor manager.
