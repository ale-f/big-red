The mutable model
=================

Although Big Red's implementation of the bigraphical model is mutable, its
objects expose only getters, not setters:

        Bigraph b;
        Root r1, r2;
        Node n;
        /* ... b contains r1 and r2, while r1 contains n... */
        assert(n.getParent() == r1); /* allowed */
        n.setParent(r2); /* not allowed */

Instead, the model introduces a layer of indirection: objects that encapsulate
the desired modifications are submitted to a /validator/, which makes sure that
the modification request makes sense, before being sent on to an /executor/,
which actually modifies the model.

Why?
----

* Undo and redo support for free

  Changes track enough information to reverse themselves, which makes it easy
  to apply and unapply them.

* Protects against both users' and programmers' mistakes

  As changes are the only way to modify the model, bugs in higher-level code
  are treated like user mistakes -- anything that leaves the model in an
  inconsistent state will be rejected.

* Temporary inconsistencies don't matter

  Some changes are validated only at the end of the validation process. This
  allows objects to be temporarily put into undesirable states without any
  consequences -- as long as those states are eventually resolved, the
  validator won't complain.

* Extensibility

  Plugins can contribute new steps to executors and validators, adding new
  kinds of modification -- or making existing checks more demanding!

How?
----

Modifying a Big Red model object is a three-step process:

	1. create objects that encapsulate the desired changes;
	2. validate them; and finally
	3. execute them.

(In practice, the last two steps can be grouped together -- changes are always
validated before they're executed.)

Simulation
----------

Validating and applying a single change is straightforward, but sequences of
changes are a bit trickier. Consider the following example:

	Change(rename root "0" to "1")
	Change(rename root "2" to "1")

In isolation, both changes are valid -- but applying either change makes it
impossible to apply the other (as that would cause a namespace collision). How
can this be tracked?

The simplest option would be to make a deep copy of the bigraph and to attempt
to modify that directly, leaving the original unchanged in the event of an
error. However, this causes serious performance problems -- particularly in the
Eclipse context, where the UI frequently speculatively creates and validates
changes. (Imagine making a new deep copy of a complex bigraph for every pixel
traversed as part of a drag operation...)

Instead, the model provides a class called the "property scratchpad", which
is used to temporarily store changes to individual property values. After
simulating the first change in a property scratchpad, for example, it might
contain the associations

	property "name" of (Root@10c) has value "1"
	property "1" of ((Bigraph@2e64)'s root namespace) has value (Root@10c)

These associations allow the second change to be rejected -- although the
underlying namespace has not been changed, the namespace can consult the
property scratchpad and sees that it contains incompatible changes.

(All of Big Red's model objects, and many of their associated helpers, expose
two accessors for each field -- one which retrieves the value directly and
another which first attempts to find it in a property scratchpad.)

Validators and executors
------------------------

Big Red's change execution system is flexible and extensible. In order to add
support for new kinds of change, or to put further constraints on existing
changes, developers must contribute "steps" to "managers".

Steps are simple, stateless objects that can only do three things: ignore,
accept, or reject a single change. Step validators accept a change by
successfully validating it, and step executors do so by executing it. If a step
doesn't implement any behaviour for a change, then it must ignore it. (An
object which is both a step validator and a step executor is also called a
"handler".)

Managers are responsible for aggregating steps together into a complete,
coherent process: when asked to perform validation or execution, they decompose
(potentially nested) change groups into a sequence of single changes, and
attempt to find one or more steps to accept each change. (A change is rejected
by the manager if either one step rejected it or all steps ignored it.)

Unlike step executors (which directly modify actual objects), step validators
need to be able to propagate their temporary modifications to their successors.
To this end, each step validator is also given a reference to the object
encapsulating the validation process, which provides a property scratchpad and
a callback mechanism (to allow parts of the validation process to be delayed
until the end).

Executor managers are also validator managers (the ExecutorManager class is a
subclass of ValidatorManager), and they will always perform validation before
attempting to execute a change. If an executor manager has no step executor
that can accept a change, then that change must not pass validation.

Although executor managers can be instantiated, there's also a static shared
instance; all of Big Red's handlers are installed into this shared manager, and
all of Big Red's validation and execution goes through this object. (Validator
managers are also step validators, so they can be included in other validation
processes; similarly, executor managers have a mechanism which allows them to
act as handlers.)

Extensions
----------

As validators and (particularly) executors may contain privileged code, it's
not normally possible to instantiate them -- they're usually private or
package-private classes which are instantiated statically before being
contributed to the static executor manager.

Static initialisation works for this (as long as the initialisation order of
classes is carefully managed), but there is another, more Eclipse-friendly
option: the model wrapper plugin exposes an extension point for contributing
new steps to the shared executor manager.
