Big Red interaction managers
============================

What is an interaction manager?
-------------------------------

An interaction manager is essentially a subprogram that operates on complete
bigraphical reactive systems. When an interaction manager is activated, it
blocks the Big Red user interface and takes control of all interaction with
the user (thus the name).

How do I write an interaction manager?
--------------------------------------

Implement the dk.itu.big_red.interaction_managers.IInteractionManager interface
(usually by subclassing the InteractionManager class from the same package).
This interface defines only three methods:

	dk.itu.big_red.interaction_managers.IInteractionManager
		setSimulationSpec(org.bigraph.model.SimulationSpec)
	org.bigraph.model.SimulationSpec
		getSimulationSpec()
	void
		run(org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell)

How do I make Big Red use an interaction manager?
-------------------------------------------------

Create an Eclipse plugin (with dependencies upon the Eclipse UI core and Big
Red), edit the plugin manifest to include an "interactionManager" extension for
the "dk.itu.big_red.interactionManagers" extension point, and then configure
this extension with the details of your interaction manager.

(An example of how to do this correctly can be found in the
doc/plugins/examples/dummy-interaction-manager/ directory.)
